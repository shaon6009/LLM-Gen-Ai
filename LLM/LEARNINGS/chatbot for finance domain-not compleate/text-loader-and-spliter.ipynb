With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) (EPS) of $1.92, the question arises: is the stock significantly overvalued? This article aims to provide a detailed valuation analysis of NVIDIA, offering insights into its financial strength, profitability, growth, and more. We invite you to delve into this comprehensive analysis.\\n\\nCompany Overview\\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with NVDA. Click here to check it out.\\n\\nNVDA 30-Year Financial Data\\n\\nThe intrinsic value of NVDA\\n\\n\\nNVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. The firm's chips are widely used in various end markets, including PC gaming and data centers. In recent years, NVIDIA has broadened its focus from traditional PC graphics applications such as gaming to more complex and favorable opportunities, including artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, leveraging the high-performance capabilities of its products.\\n\\nCurrently, NVIDIA's stock price stands at $418.01, significantly higher than the GF Value of $310.28, indicating the stock might be overvalued. With a market cap of $1 trillion, the valuation seems steep. The following analysis aims to delve deeper into the company's value.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nUnderstanding the GF Value\\nThe GF Value is a unique measure of the intrinsic value of a stock, calculated based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.\\n\\nAccording to GuruFocus Value calculation, NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) appears to be significantly overvalued. The stock's current price of $418.01 per share and the market cap of $1 trillion further strengthen this assumption.\\n\\nGiven that NVIDIA is significantly overvalued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be much lower than its future business growth.\\n\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nIs NVIDIA's Stock Significantly Overvalued? A Comprehensive Valuation Analysis\\nLink: These companies may deliver higher future returns at reduced risk.\\n\\nFinancial Strength of NVIDIA\\nExamining the financial strength of a company is crucial before investing in its stock.

Principal photography began in late 2013 and took place in Alberta, Iceland, and Los Angeles. \nInterstellar uses extensive practical and miniature effects, and the company Double Negative created additional digital effects.\n\nInterstellar premiered in Los Angeles on October 26, 2014. In the United States, it was first released on film stock, expanding to venues using digital projectors. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $677 million worldwide ($715 million after subsequent re-releases), making it the tenth-highest-grossing film of 2014. \nIt has been praised by astronomers for its scientific accuracy and portrayal of theoretical astrophysics.[5][6][7] Interstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades.\"\"\"\n\ntext[0:100]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.399833Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.400267Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.408148Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.400237Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.407017Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":9,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher N'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":"words= text.split(\" \")\nlen(words)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.409591Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.410018Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.429904Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.409972Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.428791Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":10,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"264"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chunks = []\n\ns = \"\"\nfor word in words:\n    s += word + \" \"\n    if len(s)>200:\n        chunks.append(s)\n        s = \"\"\n        \nchunks.append(s)\n\nchunks[:2]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.431461Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.431892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.447604Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.431847Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:53:09.446546Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":11,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"['Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. \\nIt stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt ',\n 'Damon, and Michael Caine. \\nSet in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in ']"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Using Text Splitter Classes from Langchain...\r\nCharacterTextSplitter**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter\n\nsplitter = CharacterTextSplitter(\n    separator = \"\\n\",\n    chunk_size=200,\n    chunk_overlap=0\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:59:32.428447Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:59:32.428961Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:59:32.434766Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:59:32.428918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:59:32.433549Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chunks = splitter.split_text(text)\nlen(chunks)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:59:34.368621Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:59:34.369007Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:59:34.376286Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:59:34.368974Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:59:34.375083Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":14,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"9"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":14},{"cell_type":"code","source":"for chunk in chunks:\n    print(len(chunk)) ","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-29T11:59:36.163710Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-29T11:59:36.164104Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-29T11:59:36.169726Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-29T11:59:36.164070Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-29T11:59:36.168601Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"105\n120\n210\n181\n197\n207\n128\n357\n253\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# RecursiveTextSplitter","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n\nr_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(\n    separators = [\"\\n\\n\", \"\\n\", \" \"],  #

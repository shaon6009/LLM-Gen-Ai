Chatbots are computer programs designed to simulate conversation with human users, either through text or voice commands. They are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies.\n\nChatbots are used in various industries, including finance, healthcare, retail, and customer service. In the finance domain, chatbots are used to provide financial advice, manage investments, and handle customer queries.\n\nIn this article, we will discuss the use of chatbots in the finance domain, their benefits, and some examples of chatbots in finance.\n\nBenefits of Chatbots in Finance\n\n1. 24/7 Availability: Chatbots are available 24/7, which means customers can access financial services at any time. This is particularly useful for customers in different time zones or those who prefer to manage their finances outside of traditional banking hours.\n\n2. Personalized Experience: Chatbots can provide personalized financial advice based on a customer's financial history, investment preferences, and other factors. This helps customers make informed decisions about their finances.\n\n3. Cost-Effective: Chatbots can handle routine tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, which frees up human customer service representatives to handle more complex queries. This reduces the workload on human customer service representatives and saves costs for the company.\n\n4. Improved Customer Experience: Chatbots can provide a seamless and convenient customer experience by allowing customers to manage their finances through messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. This eliminates the need for customers to visit a physical branch or call customer service, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient.\n\nExamples of Chatbots in Finance\n\n1. Bank of America's Erica: Erica is a virtual financial assistant that helps Bank of America customers manage their finances through their mobile devices. Erica can help customers with tasks such as checking their account balances, transferring money, and paying bills.\n\n2. Capital One's Eno: Eno is a chatbot that helps Capital One customers manage their credit card accounts. Eno can help customers with tasks such as checking their account balances, making payments, and monitoring their credit scores.\n\n"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":30},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_community.llms import HuggingFaceHub\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown\nimport os\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nos.environ[\"HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN\"] = \" "\n\n# Define the prompt template\ntemplate = \"\"\"\nYou are a Finance QNA Expert, Analyze the Query and Respond to Customer with suitable answer.
